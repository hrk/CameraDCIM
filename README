Do you hate when iPhoto won't show the pictures you shot with your Android device, but it works fine with your friend's HTC Sense device? Why would that be?!?

That's simply because Google's camera does not comply with the DCIM standard [1], used by every other Digital Camera in the world (and HTC Sense does too!)

With this app, your Android device will be able to.

FEATURES:
- DCIM compliant digital camera
- Full Gingerbread Camera, as of latest source code (Android 2.3.5)
- Camera DCIM can be installed together with the official Android Camera, no overlapping issues!
- Camcorder app has been unhidden and can be choosen from the application launcher
- Support for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X hosts (don't worry about Thumbds.db, ._IMG0001.jpg files and so on!)
- "Automagically" converts existing picture files in Camera dir to the DCIM naming.

SOURCE CODE:
Google has been notified of this issue on June 2009 [2] but has ignored it.
I've submitted a fix for the officla Android Camera on July 9th, 2011 [3] with no reply. If you are able to build your own ROM, I welcome you to download the fix and apply it to your source code! HTC has built a DCIM compliant camera, after all.

The original fix (using com.android.camera package) can be found in the three dcim-compliant-[1-3].patch files. As a sidenote, dcim-compliant-2.patch must be considered revered (-R) to work. Sorry for the confusion. :)

All the modified source code (in addition to the original fix) is available online to whoever wishes to check it out [4]
